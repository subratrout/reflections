Q.1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When I initialize the repository a .git folder is created which holds the snapshots of all changes commited to my files in the folder.


Q 2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
